What does RGMS do?
Since I didn't make the service I can't be 100% sure. But from the name and previous post, I suggest that it is looking for games you're playing in order to use that information in Razer Synapse. If you want to use any functionality that requires game-info within Razer Synapse don't disable the service.

How to disable RGMS
What you want to do is disable RGM-Service. However, at first, you won't be able to due to the fact that Razer Synapse Service is dependent on RGMS.

Thus we are going to remove the dependency:
Hit windows-key+R and type in "regedit". Afterward, press enter.

Navigate to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Razer Synapse Service"

Remove "Razer Game Manager Service" from "DependendOnService" by double-clicking it and then removing that name.

(You might have to restart in order for the changes to take effect)

Now go into services and disable RGMS:
Hit windows-key+R and type in "services.msc". Afterward, press enter.

Find "Razer Game Manager"

Right-click and then click on "settings"

Change "start type" to "disabled"

Also, hit "stop"



(Sorry if some translations of settings are incorrect. My windows is not set to English. If you spot any errors, mention it in a comment and I will correct them)

Edit:
Once Synapse installs an update you will be greated with a screen saying something like "start failed".

The (shortened) reason behind this is that the dependency that was removed in this tutorial is placed back into the registry for some reason.

To fix this problem, re-do the above step named: "Thus we are going to remove the dependency".

Afterwards restart your system and everything should be back to normal.
